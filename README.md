R2D2 is a server of artifacts to be used with maven , gradle Ivy and others.

The little robot R2-D2 is one of the main characters of the Star Wars saga. He is an astromech droid, responsible for maintenance and navigation spacecraft. Speaks a "language" incomprehensible and beep sounds (and inspired Kenny from South Park). 
R2-D2 and C-3PO are the only characters in the series to appear in 6 films played by the same actors. Kenny Baker was the dwarf actor who starred in the droid in five of the six films in the series. Despite appearing in the credits of the movie Revenge of the Sith, Kenny never filmed any scenes of this episode.
